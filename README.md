## FAQ

**Q : Does this starter include any business logic?**  
A : No.  It's a clean scaffolding meant for you to drop your own code into.

**Q : Where do tasks live?**  
A : Inside `.taskmaster/`.  The repo ships with templates only; you generate tasks by running `task-master parse-prd <prd.md>`.
